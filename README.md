## About me ðŸ‘‹


**shazia-abbas/shazia-abbas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Public health researcher with experience in Epidemiology and Biostatistics.
- I am  looking to collaborate on projects related to cardiovascular diseases, maternal and child health and HIV & AIDS. 

  I can be reached via [title] (shazia.khoja@gmail.com)
